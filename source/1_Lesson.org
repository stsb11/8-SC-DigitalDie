- A Die can be used to generate a single digit /random/ number between 1 and 6.
- Having a digital version could be quite handy, especially when it's time for family board games.
- There is a small problem with generating random numbers using a microprocessor or a computer however. In fact it's nearly impossible.
** Research It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
- Have a read of [[http://www.howtogeek.com/183051/htg-explains-how-computers-generate-random-numbers/][this article]]. It explains (sometimes in a little too much detail) why random numbers are important.
** Badge It - Silver
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- Try and answer the following questions:
  1. What is a pseudorandom number?
  2. What is a true random number?
  3. What is the example given for how a computer can generate a random number?
** Badge It - Gold

- You've had some experience with programming micro-controllers now, so you should have some idea of how they work.
- Brainstorm some different ideas for how different input components could be used to generate some random numbers. What sensors could you use?
