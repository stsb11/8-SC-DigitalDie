- Your initial board should look like this.
[[./img/pcbplain.jpg]]
- You should be able to solder on the first few components without any guidance.
- Start with the smallest components first.
- *Make sure the diode and the 78L05 voltage regulator are in the correct way around* (or you might give yourself a bit of a suprise).
- Your board should look like this when it is finsihed.

- With the basic components soldered to the board, you now need to add in the LEDs.
- The LEDs will be fitted using 2 spacers.
- Follow the guide below *carefully*.
- Take an LED and the two spacers.
[[./img/ledspacerstart.jpg]]
- Place the one LED through the centre of the spacers.
[[./img/ledspacer.jpg]]
- Now holding the LED and spacers together, place the carefully on the PCB and solder the LED in place. 
- *Make sure the LED is as close to the spacers as can be when you are finished soldering.*
- You can now get the next 6 LED's ready.
[[./img/allLED.jpg]]
- You can now add the rest of the LED's. *Make sure you have the long leg(+) in the correct hole.*
[[./img/allLEDonboard.jpg]]
- *Now you must download your program to the board and test it before continuing.*

- Take a picture of the solder side and component side of your board.
- Upload your program to your board and make sure it works. Take a photo of your board working.
- Your badge will be awarded according to the quality of your work.
