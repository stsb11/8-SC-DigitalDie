- GENIE chips can be programmed with several configurations.
- We'll need 1 pin to provide power to the chip and 1 pin to tie it to ground.
- We'll need 1 pin to program the chip.
- We'll need 1 pin to receive an input.
- This leaves us with 4 pins to play with.
- By right clicking on the GENIE chip in Circuit Wizard, we can choose >Program>Program Settings
[[file:img/programChoice.png]]
- Make sure you have a C08 chip sellected.
- Now you can use the check boxes to make different pins inputs or outputs.
- We're going to want to have as many outputs as possible, so this configuration is probably the best.

- If we want to make a die, we need to be able to represent the numbers 1-6 using LEDs
- But we can't simply connect an LED to each output pin, as we only have 4 output pins to use.
- Build the circuit as shown below.

- Here's a circuit that allows any number from 1-6 to be displayed by sending output pins high.
[[file:img/arrangement1.png]]
- Try to come up with your own arrangement, where we could have any number of LEDs fom 1-6, switch on using only 4 outputs.
- Screenshot your circuit when you have finished it.

- We're going to use the circuit shown below to program our Die.It's identical to the one before it, but the LEDs have been placed differently.
[[file:img/studentCircuit.png]]
- It's a little hard to construct, so you can [[file:doc/StudentCircuit.cwz][download it here]]
- It might help you to understand how the outputs control the LEDs by using the simulation below.

- Use the simulation to write down which outputs will need to be set to /high/ for each number the die will generate from 1 through to 6.
- Using the diagram below and any graphics package you choose, draw a basic diagram to show how the arrangement of LEDs will be connected to the pins of the GENIE chip.

- With this information, you should now be able to create a program to generate the random numbers.
- You've quite a bit of experience using flowcharts to program GENIE chips already, so here is the start of the flowchart only.

- Use the file you downloaded earlier and your knowledge of which outputs to send high to complete the program and test it to make sure it works.
- Take a screenshot of your program when you have finished.

- There are many ways of solving this probems.
- See if you can come up with an alternative algorithm that doesn't use the =Random= block.
- Take a screenshot of your program when it is complete.
